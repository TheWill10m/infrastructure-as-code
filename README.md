# Infrastructure as Code

This repository contains my (work in progress) infrastructure as code. This can be used to deploy the infrastructure that I use in my Homelab.

## Tools

I use [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) to deploy and test my code. It should work with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) too, but I can't guarantee it.
